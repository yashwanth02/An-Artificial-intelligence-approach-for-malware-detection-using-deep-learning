In our study, we combined Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning algorithms to detect malware in images. We found that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm of deep learning exhibited notably higher accuracy compared to other methods. Consequently, we exclusively employed the CNN algorithm for malware detection due to its superior performance, ensuring robust and effective detection capabilities in our research.
